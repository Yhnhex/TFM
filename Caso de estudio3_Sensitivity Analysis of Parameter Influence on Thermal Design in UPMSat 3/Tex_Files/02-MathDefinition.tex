\chapter{Problem definition}\label{ch:chapter02}
As presented on \autoref{ch:chapter01}, parameter selection is a key step when creating and/or using models in almost any field, more so, in the space sector where everything has an extra cost associated. However, when talking more specifically about the thermal control for space missions, there are not so many techniques to extract the parameters that define the physics of the problem with most accuracy and observability. This is due to the fact that it has usually been overlooked, never optimizing the amount of information extracted from testing and mission monitoring. Thus, among this chapter the developed method is presented, along with the requirements the system must fulfil in order to use it.

\section{Algorithm definition}
A scheme of the method is developed on \autoref{fig:diagram}. The method has been implemented on Python \cite{python} using the Pycanha package \cite{navajas2024improvement}, a thermal analysis tool developed by Dr.Piqueras that joins a Python front-end with a C+ background in order to get a user-friendly, yet fast thermal solver. All the functions and features created along this project have been implemented as libraries of this package, and can now be obtained open source on GitHub. Apart from pycanha, other commercial libraries such as NumPy \cite{numpy} and SciPy \cite{scipy} -For mathematical purposes- and Matplotlib \cite{matplotlib} have been used. Throughout the following sections each step of the algorithm is briefly explained.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figures/influence_diagram.png}
    \caption{Flow diagram of the method algorithm}
    \label{fig:diagram}
\end{figure}

\section{Data Read}
The first step of the method consist of the acquisition of data, whether it comes from an external model or if it has been developed directly with Pycanha. This second option is way easier, as the data read would be as easy as reading the TMM object, and all the parameters, associated formulas, geometrical definition etc. would be known. However, as pycanha is still on development it is quite difficult to create any kind of complex system, due to the lack of a graphic interface to create the geometry. 

In order to make the package more usable with regard to bigger projects, the compatibility with the most extended  spacecraft thermal analysis tool, ESATAN-TMS \cite{esatan-tms}, is provided within the package. The files that pycanha uses to replicate the model created in esatan are the .TMD and some of the .data files, which must be exported separately.

The .TMD files are binary coded files that result from each charge case, and they contain all the necessary information to run a TMM. These files give directly the lineal and radiative coupling matrices $K$ and $R$, the thermal capacities $C$ and the boundary conditions $Q$, and with that the system of equations presented on \autoref{eq: balance}, can be solved.

However, this just gives the numerical result, eliminating all the parameters and formulas that are associated to the calculations of these matrices, which would not be useful to make any kind of analysis, so they have to be overwritten. Thus, after reading the .TMD, the .CONSTANTS.data and .LOCALS.data are read first and then, once the TMM has the parameters, the formulas are read in .COUPLINGS.data.

To summarize:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create an empty TMM object.
\item Read the .TMD file with all the numerical data.
\item Read the parameters files.
\item Overwrite de conductances gotten from the .TMD with the formulas associated to the arameters.
\end{itemize}

\section{Manual filter}
Once all the data has been read, the engineer has to choose an initial set of parameters to begin the analysis with. This task must be done manually as it is not a matter of influence or sensitivity but the kind of parameters one wants to study. It takes not only an important engineering knowledge but also a great understanding of the model itself to be able to select an optimum set of parameters. 

It will be further explained on latter chapters, but these choices are way easier to make if the model is developed by the same person who makes the analysis, as the parametrization will be purposefully done in a way that simplifies this task; this is the case for the 2 first cases that are analyzed, where due to this (and to the simpliccity of the models), this step can be skipped. However, in the third case, the UPMSat3 model is way more complex than the other two example cases and furthermore,  it has been developed by a different person who had no idea of the purpose of this parametrization, which highlights the importance of this step.

However, for the proposed analysis, the materials and coatings do not change, and thus, neither does the thermo-optical properties, the densities or the conductivities associated to them. The radiative conductances were not even parametrized in first place, but as the thermo-optical properties do not  change and neither does the geometry, they will not be part of this initial set. Other parameters such as TIME or PERIOD do not variate either so can also be excluded. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, the study does not take into account the time variation, it is stationary, and thus the thermal capacities, have been also excluded.

Taking this filter into account, the final list must mainly comprehend lineal conductances $G_L$, or alternatively the $h_c$.


\section{Jacobian and influence matrix calculation}
The algorithm uses the influence matrix to find which parameters have most influence on which nodes. In order to do that, it is necessary to calculate the Jacobian or Sensitivity matrix $\boldsymbol{M_t}$, defined by the derivatives of the temperature $T_i$ at each node with respect to each parameter $p_j$, 

\begin{equation}
    \boldsymbol{M_t} = \frac{\partial T_i}{\partial p_j} =\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{\partial T_1}{\partial p_1}  & \frac{\partial T_1}{\partial p_2}  & \ldots & \frac{\partial T_1}{\partial p_{N_P}}  \\
\ldots & \ldots & & \ldots \\
\frac{\partial T_{N_N}}{\partial p_1}  & \frac{\partial T_{N_N}}{\partial p_2}  & \ldots & \frac{\partial T_{N_N}}{\partial p_{N_P}} 
\end{array}\right].
\end{equation}

For really simple models, the Jacobian can be obtained analytically, but in general there is no analytical solution, and it must be computed numerically. Thus, the approach has been to approximate these derivatives by central finite differences\footnote{The options of forward and backward differences have also been implemented}. The central difference approximation for the partial derivative $\frac{\partial T_i}{\partial p_j}$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial T_i}{\partial p_j} \approx \frac{T_i(p_j + \Delta p_j) - T_i(p_j - \Delta p_j)}{2 \Delta p_j}
\end{equation}

Here, $\Delta p_j$ is a small perturbation applied to the parameter $p_j$. The central difference method is chosen because it provides a more accurate approximation of the derivative compared to forward or backward differences, especially when dealing with numerical computations.

To determine the appropriate perturbation $\Delta p_j$ for each parameter $p_j$,the following expression is used:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta p_j = p_j \cdot \sqrt{\varepsilon}
\end{equation}

where $\varepsilon$ is the machine epsilon for floating-point arithmetic, meaning the upper bound on the relative error due to rounding in floating-point calculations. In Python, this can be obtained using \lstinline{epsilon = np.finfo(float).eps}

The perturbation $\Delta p_j$ is chosen as a small fraction of the parameter $p_j$ itself, scaled by the square root of the machine epsilon. This  ensures that the perturbation is neither too large (which could lead to inaccurate approximations due to nonlinear effects) nor too small (which could result in numerical inaccuracies due to round-off errors).

To summarize, the computation of the Jacobian matrix $\bm{M_t}$ using central differences can be written as:


\begin{equation}
    \left(\bm{M_t}\right)_{ij} = \frac{T_i(p_j + \Delta p_j) - T_i(p_j - \Delta p_j)}{2 \Delta p_j},
\end{equation}

with


\begin{equation}
    \Delta p_j = p_j \cdot \sqrt{\varepsilon},
\end{equation}

 ensuring a balanced trade-off between accuracy and numerical stability in the computation of the derivatives.

However, in order to choose the most adequate parameters to determine the reduced model, the matrix of influence $\mathbf{I}_{\mathbf{X}}$ is defined below:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{I}_{\mathbf{X}}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\frac{\partial T_1}{\partial p_1} \delta p_1 & \frac{\partial T_1}{\partial p_2} \delta p_2 & \ldots & \frac{\partial T_1}{\partial p_{N_P}} \delta p_{N_P} \\
\ldots & \ldots & & \ldots \\
\frac{\partial T_{N_N}}{\partial p_1} \delta p_1 & \frac{\partial T_{N_N}}{\partial p_2} \delta p_2 & \ldots & \frac{\partial T_{N_N}}{\partial p_{N_P}} \delta p_{N_P}
\end{array}\right]=\mathbf{M} \delta \boldsymbol{P}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{M_t}$ is the jacobian or sensibility matrix defined in the previous section, and $ \delta \boldsymbol{P}$ is a vector containing the allowable variation of each parameter within the design. In the influence matrix $\mathbf{I}_{\mathbf{X}}$ each column represents the temperature variation of the nodes that would be generated by a deviation on the parameter $ \delta p_i$. Therefore, the elements of this matrix have dimensions of temperature, showing the effect of every parameter in the model, which would not be possible using the jacobian matrix directly.

Preliminarly,  the parameter deviation $ \delta \boldsymbol{P}$ was taken as a 10\% deviation of the parameters, as at first the real allowable deviation was not available. It is interesting to see the change in the results between both of these deviations (see Chapter 5) as it shows the importance of using the influence matrix instead of just the jacobian. Representations of influence matrices will be seen and analyzed in latter chapters, for example in \autoref{ch:03}

\section{Normalization and importance filter}\label{s:infmat}
Each influence matrix shows the effect of varying each one of the parameters in terms of temperature, giving an easy visible relation of the importance of each parameter and where it can be measured. However, in order to choose which parameters to continue with, the influence is normalized as follows:


\begin{equation}I_{X_j}=\frac{\left[\sum_{i=1}^{N_N}I_{Xij}^2\right]^{1/2}}{max_j\left(\left[\sum_{i=1}^{N_N}I_{Xij}^2\right]^{1/2}\right)},\end{equation}

where $I_{Xij}$ are the values of the influence matrix $\boldsymbol{I_X}$. This way it is easier to see the impact each parameter has on the model, and then choose the most optimal ones to run the tests.

With this in mind, a second filter is set so that if the normalized global influence of the parameters is below a threshold $\varepsilon_{gi}$, they are eliminated.
This process should retain the most important parameters, eliminating first the ones that are not useful for further analysis, and now the ones we can not measure adequately, leaving now one last step to ensure that all the parameters are linearly independent.

\section{Linear dependence filter}\label{s:ldfilter}
With the influence matrix properly calculated, one last filter is applied. Within this step, the intention is to eliminate the parameters that are linearly dependent among themselves. In order to see this dependence, the Pearson correlation coefficient matrix is used. These coefficients measure the linear correlation between two variables, returning a value between -1 and +1. The closest the value of the coefficient is to +1 or -1, the more linearly dependent those values are, either directly (+1) or inversely (-1).

For a dataset with \( p \) variables (in this case the parameters, disposed as columns of the influence matrix), the Pearson correlation coefficient matrix \( \mathbf{R} \) is a \( p \times p \) matrix where each element \( r_{ij} \) is the Pearson correlation coefficient between the \( i \)-th and \( j \)-th variables.

Given a data matrix \( \mathbf{M} \) of size \( n \times p \), where \( n \) is the number of observations (in this case nodes), the Pearson correlation coefficient matrix can be computed as follows:

First, the data matrix \( \mathbf{M} \) is standardized to have zero mean and unit variance:
   \[
   \mathbf{Z} = \frac{\boldsymbol{I_X} - \mathbf{\mu}}{\mathbf{\sigma}},
   \]
where \( \mathbf{\mu} \) is a vector of means and \( \mathbf{\sigma} \) is a vector of standard deviations for each parameter.

Then, the Pearson correlation coefficient matrix \( \mathbf{R} \) is calculated as:
   \[
   \mathbf{R} = \frac{1}{n-1} \mathbf{Z}^\top \mathbf{Z}, 
   \]

which, in matrix notation, can be written as:

\[
\mathbf{R} = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
1 & r_{12} & \cdots & r_{1p} \\
r_{21} & 1 & \cdots & r_{2p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
r_{p1} & r_{p2} & \cdots & 1 \\
\end{array} \right],
\]

where each \( r_{ij} \) is computed using the standardized data matrix \( \mathbf{Z} \).

The Pearson correlation coefficient \( r_{ij} \) between the \( i \)-th and \( j \)-th variables can also be expressed in terms of the dot product of their standardized values:

\[
r_{ij} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n} (z_{ik} z_{jk})}{n-1},
\]

where \( z_{ik} \) and \( z_{jk} \) are the \( k \)-th observations of the \( i \)-th and \( j \)-th standardized variables, respectively.

Taking the absolute value of this matrix $\mid \mathbf{R}\mid$, we have a diagonal and symmetrical matrix with values going from 0 to +1, (with the main diagonal filled with ones) where the closest a value is to 1, the more linearly related are the corresponding parameters. Thus, a correlation threshold $\varepsilon_{LD}$ is set around 0.997, and whenever any pair of parameters is higher than the threshold, one parameter of the pair is eliminated.  

After that, the columns corresponding to those parameters $p_{LD}$ are eliminated from the Influence matrix, resulting in a reduced matrix $I_{Xli}$, standing for linearly independent.


\section{FPGA model}

An FPGA, or Field-Programmable Gate Array, is a type of electronic device that can be programmed by the user after it has been manufactured. This means that an FPGA can be configured to perform a wide variety of tasks, making it very versatile and very useful for space missions. However, they usually have a simple and very similar disposition of components, which makes them easy to thermally model.

In this case, the thermal model disposition is based on the one in \cite{amd2024}, and it has been represented on \autoref{fig:FPGA-model} 
img
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{Figures/FPGA/FPGA-model.png}
    \caption{FPGA thermal model representation.}
    \label{fig:FPGA-model}
\end{figure}

Here, in the following table, the nodes are named in order to explain and clarify the model and the dissipation of each of them is also defined,

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Node definition for the FPGA model.}
    \label{tab:nodesFPGA}
    \begin{tabular}{c c c}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Node Number}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Structure Part}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{$\boldsymbol{Q_I}$ [W]} \\\midrule
    1 & Board  & 3 \\
    2 & Junction  & 0 \\
    3 & Case  & 0 \\
    4 & Heat sink  & 0 \\
    5 & Strap joint  & 0 \\
    6 & Structure A  & 0 \\
    7 & PCB frame  & 0 \\
    9 & Environment  & 0 \\\bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}

As can be seen in \autoref{fig:FPGA-model}, the radiation is considered at two nodes only; in the Board one, since the temperature difference with the environment reaches its peak here, and in node 4, as the main purpose of the heat sink is to radiate heat to the environment. The rest of the structure is radiatively ignored due to the small size of the visible areas and the simplicity of the model. Apart from this, the environment temperature was set to 293.15 K.

Having been above-mentioned, this model was directly developed with the pycanha package, with the main purpose of using this method, which is why the parameters that define the model are all $G_Ls$. Thus, the first step of manually selecting these conductances can be skipped. The parameters are presented in \autoref{tab:GLsFPGA} below:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Parameter definition for the FPGA model.}
\label{tab:GLsFPGA}

\begin{tabular}{c c c}
\toprule
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Parameter}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Description}} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Value}[W]} \\ \midrule
$GL_{12}$  & Conductance between the board and the junction  & 0.5 \\ 
$GL_{23}$  & Conductance between the junction and the case  &  2\\ 
$GL_{34}$  & Conductance between the case and the Heat sink  & 0.2 \\ 
$GL_{45}$  & Conductance between the Heat sink and the thermal strap joint  & 0.15 \\ 
$GL_{56}$  & Conductance between the thermal strap joint and the structure  & 0.15 \\ 
$GL_{17}$  & Conductance between the Board and the Board frame  & 0.4 \\ 
$GL_{76}$  & Conductance between the Board frame and the Structure  & 0.4 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Again, as the initial list does not compel any extra parameter (optical properties, conductivities, thermal capacities etc.) the initial list of parameters is the one in \autoref{tab:GLsFPGA}. Thus, we can proceed to calculate the jacobian matrix.

The Jacobian matrix result is presented in 

\begin{equation}
    \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{$\displaystyle
\boldsymbol{J} =\begin{bmatrix}
    7.63 \cdot 10^{-6} & -2.37 \cdot 10^{0} & -1.36 \cdot 10^{0} & -1.18 \cdot 10^{0} & -1.58 \cdot 10^{1} & -8.39 \cdot 10^{-4} & -3.24 \cdot 10^{-4} \\

  \end{bmatrix},
    $}
\label{eq:jacobianFPGA}
\end{equation}

this matrix does not really throw us much information, but following the algorithm, the  Jacobian matrix is used to obtain the influence matrix. In this case, the deviation used to compute this matrix was taken from \cite{amd2024}, and it can be seen on \autoref{tab:deviationGLsFPGA}

     \end{figure}

In \autoref{fig:infmatFPGA} it can be seen that the columns corresponding to parameters $GL\_12$, $GL\_56$ and 76 look quite similar, due to the fact that nodes 5 and 7 are unnecessary, as they are not dissipating any heat, nor radiatively nor conductively. 

The next step is to see the normalized influence of the parameters, which can be seen in \autoref{fig:globalinfFPGA}. Setting the influence threshold on $\varepsilon_I = 0.1$, in this case all the parameters are way aboveit, possibly due to the fact that being such a simple model it is difficult for any parameter to not be representative.

Finally, following the procedure from \autoref{s:ldfilter}, one can calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficients Matrix, getting the following matrix:

\begin{equation}

  \end{bmatrix},
  $}
\end{equation}
where it can be appreciated that the values of $r_{57}$, $r_{12}$ and $r_{75}$ are above the $\varepsilon_{LD}$, thus making these parameters linearly dependent. We have chosen to retain only $GL_{12}$, due to the physical importance of that parameter.


 Thus, the parameters that are chosen to study the FPGA model are:
